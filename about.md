## Brief bio
I am bouncing between being a student, researcher, and software engineer. Currently, I am finishing up my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This summer (2020), I will be working on Google Cloud network infrastructure in Madison, WI (unless COVID-19 changes things that is). In the fall, I will be starting graduate school working towards my Master's of Engineering in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University. See my [CV](http://michaelneuder.github.io/michaelneuder.github.io/images/cv.pdf) or [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-neuder/) for more information.
